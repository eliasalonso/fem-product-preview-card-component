## My process

I started by defining the scope of my project, including its goals and objectives. I identified the requirements and features my project should include, such as designing a product card web page. Then, I created a plan outlining the tasks and steps needed to complete the project.

Next, I began designing the layout of the product card using HTML and CSS. I structured the HTML file by defining the basic HTML elements like <head>, <body>, and various tags for content organization. For the visual elements, I selected suitable fonts and imported them using Google Fonts API. I used CSS styles to customize the colors, fonts, spacing, and responsiveness of the product card. To make it responsive, I used media queries to adjust the layout for different screen sizes.

I collected and prepared the necessary content for the product card, such as product images and descriptions. I optimized the images for web display by resizing and compressing them for faster loading.

In terms of HTML structure, I used semantic tags to provide meaning and structure to the content. I organized the content into logical sections, such as the product category, name, description, pricing, and add-to-cart button.

To style the product card, I applied CSS styles to format and enhance its appearance. I defined CSS classes and IDs to target specific elements and applied the appropriate styles. I also used CSS variables to store and reuse color values and font families. Additionally, I created CSS rules for different media queries to ensure the design is responsive across different devices.

Throughout the process, I tested the product card web page in various browsers to ensure consistent rendering and functionality. I checked for any CSS or HTML errors and made necessary adjustments or fixes. I also verified that the page layout and content were displayed correctly on different devices and screen sizes.

Finally, I made final adjustments and refinements to the design based on feedback or personal preferences. I ensured that the project files and assets were properly organized and documented. I reviewed the overall functionality, design, and responsiveness of the product card to ensure it met my project's requirements.
